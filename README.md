# ATM-Simulation
Console-based ATM based off of old CS2 project. Heavily expanded upon it to include login PINs, admin accounts and numerous different options.

The project also used to use an ArrayList to store data, but at one point, I reworked it to use HashMaps. The ATMSimulation folder has a file that contains that code as well.
